 Iterates as determined by @rhombus(maybe_each) and @rhombus(each, ~for_clause) clauses among the
 @rhombus(clause_or_body)s, where a non-empty @rhombus(maybe_each) is converted to
 an initial @rhombus(each, ~for_clause) before all @rhombus(clause_or_body)s.
 An @rhombus(each, ~for_clause) clause forms one layer
 of iteration; each subsequent part of the body is evaluated once per
 iteration, and additional @rhombus(each, ~for_clause) groups form nested
 iterations.

 The expression after @rhombus(in) or block after a binding within
 an @rhombus(each, ~for_clause) clause must produce
 a @tech{sequence}. When @rhombus(for) is static (see
 @rhombus(use_static)), static information for the expression or block must indicate
 a static sequence implementation that may specialize iteration over the
 sequence; see also @rhombus(Sequence, ~annot) and @rhombus(statinfo_meta.sequence_constructor_key).
 A fresh @tech{instantiation} of the sequence is used each
 time the @rhombus(for) form is evaluated. Each element of that sequence is bound in turn to
 the @rhombus(lhs_bind) variables of the @rhombus(each, ~for_clause). If a sequence
 can have multiple values as its elements (for example, a map as a
 sequence has a key and value for each element), then
 @rhombus(lhs_bind) can be a @rhombus(values, ~bind) pattern or just a
 parenthesized sequence of bindings to receive a matching number of
 element values.

 An @rhombus(each, ~for_clause) followed immediately by a sequence binding is
 equivalent to @rhombus(each, ~for_clause) followed immediately by a block that
 contains the sequence binding. When multiple sequences are used in
 one iteration layer (i.e., in a block immediately after
 @rhombus(each, ~for_clause)), iteration stops as soon as one of the sequences in
 the layer is exhausted.

 A @rhombus(keep_when, ~for_clause) or @rhombus(skip_when, ~for_clause) clause short-circuits one
 iteration of the @rhombus(for) body, skipping remaining clauses
 (including nested iterations) when the subsequent @rhombus(expr)
 produces @rhombus(#false) for @rhombus(keep_when, ~for_clause) or a true value for
 @rhombus(skip_when, ~for_clause). A @rhombus(break_when, ~for_clause) clause short-circuits the current
 iteration and all would-be remaining iterations of the @rhombus(for)
 form when its @rhombus(expr) produces a true value. A @rhombus(final_when, ~for_clause)
 clause is similar to @rhombus(break_when, ~for_clause), but it allows one iteration to
 complete before skipping the remaining iterations.

 A @rhombus(keep_let, ~for_clause) clause is like
 @rhombus(keep_when, ~for_clause), but proceeds to remaining clauses
 only if all values match the bindings, and the bindings become
 visible to remaining clauses.

 New @rhombus(for) clause forms can be defined as macros that
 (eventually) expand to the core forms that are recognized by
 @rhombus(for).

 If a @rhombus(reducer) is specified, either before the block or at the
 end with @rhombus(~into), it determines how each result of the last
 @rhombus(body) is combined to produce a result of the overall
 @rhombus(for) expression, otherwise the result of the last
 @rhombus(body) is ignored and the @rhombus(for) expression's value is
 @rhombus(#void). Example reducers include @rhombus(List, ~reducer),
 @rhombus(Map, ~reducer), and @rhombus(values, ~reducer).
